The AB-test data
The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:

userid - a unique number that identifies each player.
version - whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40).
sum_gamerounds - the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install.
retention_1 - did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?
retention_7 - did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?
When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40. As a sanity check, let's see if there are roughly the same number of players in each AB group.
